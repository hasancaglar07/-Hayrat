Send blessings upon him and his household who shine like stars, with a blessing like a pouring, continual rain. O Allah! Send blessings upon him, for he is the wisest of the Arabs, the most eloquent in expression and tongue, highest in faith, loftiest in rank, sweetest in speech, most faithful to his covenants, and purest in lineage. He clarified and explained the path of Islam, exalted it, broke the idols, made Your rulings manifest, turned people away from what is unlawful, and bestowed favors on the believers. So send blessings upon him and his household with the most excellent blessings in every place and assembly where angels, jinn and humans circle. Send upon him a blessing that You make for us provision in the Hereafter, night and day, after which come the fragrances of mercy sweeter than musk, followed by Your forgiveness and pleasure. O Allah! Send blessings upon him, for he is the best from whom goodness is sought; from his brow light increases, and the sun and moon take from his light; beside his generosity the clouds and seas are small; the earth shines with its signs; his miracles are told by the Qur'an and the mass-transmitted reports. Send blessings upon him and his household, and upon his companions who migrated with him and helped his religion, the best of emigrants and helpers. As long as birds sing the hymns of Your remembrance in the thick trees, and clouds without lightning pour down heavy rain, send continuous blessings upon him. And by the continuance of Your blessings, grant him multiplied reward."
